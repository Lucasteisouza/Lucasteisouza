## Hello! I am **Lucas Souza**!

### Aspiring Web Developer!

Ex-microbiologist currently going thru a career transition to become a Web Developer.

I've always been interested in programming and every innovation this skill can bring to the world.
I decided to take Trybe's course in Web Development to learn more.
Trybe is a very recognized school with a teaching method based mainly on practical application skills.

I hope to be able to improve people's lives through programming.
